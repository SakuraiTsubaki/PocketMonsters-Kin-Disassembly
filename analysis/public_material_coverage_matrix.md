# Public Material Coverage Matrix — Pocket Monsters Kin / Pokémon Gold

Started: 2026-09-14

## Rule

This project does not treat a handful of well-known repositories as an exhaustive survey. The survey remains open until every material class below has been searched for the Japanese origin release, each known Japanese revision/development lineage, and every official regional/localized release. `NOT_FOUND` never means nonexistence; it means no public source has yet been located in the searched corpus.

Status values:
- `NOT_STARTED`
- `SEARCHING`
- `FOUND`
- `CROSS_VERIFIED`
- `PRIMARY_SOURCE_FOUND`
- `CONFLICT`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Sources newly added to the live census in this pass

- Nintendo official Gold/Silver retrospective series, including guidebook-production recollections and later official explanations of mechanics.
- Game Preservation Society catalog index and individual contemporary Japanese Gold/Silver guidebook records.
- `Greatpriceman/pokegold-ko` and `Greatpriceman/pokegold-kr` historical Korean disassembly/research lineages.
- `pret/pokegold-spaceworld` complete public Space World 1997 demo lineage plus derivative translation/restoration forks; derivatives are never treated as original prototype evidence without comparison.
- Bulbapedia Japanese Generation II event-distribution index as a discovery source for Space World 2000 Celebi, World Hobby Fair Celebi, Mystery Egg campaigns, and related distribution leads.
- `pret/pokecrystal` bugs/glitches documentation and unused-data documentation as cross-generation technical leads when Gold/Silver behavior is shared or explicitly contrasted.

## Completion rule

No source category is considered exhausted merely because one source was found. Each row must be searched across Japanese and original-language queries, known archives, GitHub/forks, bibliographic databases, contemporary press, and regional communities. Claims are promoted only after provenance and independence of sources are checked.
